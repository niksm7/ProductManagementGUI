# Product Management System 
This is a Product Management system created with Tkinter which is the GUI tool of Python and pickle module is used for storage
There are 3 files created for reusability to its code.
The first file(first.py) contains the class Product.
The second file(second.py) contains main functions of the buttons also the class is imported from first file.
The third file(main.py) contains the GUI code along with the function also everything is imported from the second file.

NOTE: YOU HAVE TO JUST RUN main.py BUT ALSO MAKE SURE OTHER TWO FILES ARE AT THE SAME PLACE.

Here you can perform the following actions:
* Add new products 
* Update the existing products
* Delete products
* Save the Changes
* Display the complete product list that is saved

You can perform the above actions as:
* To add a product first make sure the Id you entered is unique or else it won't except also make sure to fill all the boxes.

* To update a product just enter the ID of the product and click on update button it will automatically fill in all the boxes with the details and make the ID box read only beacuse ID cannot be changed then after changing again click on update.

* To delete the product just enter the id and hit enter it will ask you are you sure you want to delete if you click yes it will delete otherwise not.

* Make sure to save the changes after you are done with everything before closing the system or else it won't effect the data in the pickle storage.

* To display the stored data just hit Display button and the details will be shown in your terminal.
